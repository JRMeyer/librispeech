There are two sets of lexicons here (full vs mini)
because the original download of Librispeech only
comes with the full dict for the entire mondo corpus.

So, to make things more manageable, I limit the dict
to words found in the transcripts of the audio I have.

The audio I have here is just a small section of LibriSpeech.



# Jan 29, 2018: removed "LL   L" as entry from lexicon (in the transcripts
# I'LL was mistakenly I LL and WE'LL was WE LL for a couple entries)


## VOICING NOTES:
After I collapse voicing, I get pronunciation variants which are identical,
and this crashes, so I'm throwing out the doubles.
