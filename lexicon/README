There are two sets of lexicons here (full vs mini)
because the original download of Librispeech only
comes with the full dict for the entire mondo corpus.

So, to make things more manageable, I limit the dict
to words found in the transcripts of the audio I have.

The audio I have here is just a small section of LibriSpeech.



# Jan 29, 2018: removed "LL   L" as entry from lexicon (in the transcripts
# I'LL was mistakenly I LL and WE'LL was WE LL for a couple entries)


## VOICING NOTES:     

B P   --> P
CH JH --> CH
D T   --> T
DH TH --> TH
F V   --> F
G K   --> G
S Z   --> S
SH ZH --> SH

sed -Ei "s/B/P/g" filename
sed -Ei "s/JH/CH/g" filename
sed -Ei "s/D/T/g" filename # gets DH-->TH as well
sed -Ei "s/F/V/g" filename
sed -Ei "s/K/G/g" filename # avoiding G-->K because of NG
sed -Ei "s/Z/S/g" filename # gets SH-->ZH as well


After I collapse voicing, I get pronunciation variants which are identical,
and this crashes, so I'm throwing out the doubles.

## Manner Notes

take out manner, only have place and voicing info left:


should work with sed in this order:

P F     --> P          voiceless labials
B M V W --> W          voiced labials
SH CH   --> CH         voiceless postalveolar
T S     --> T          voiceless alveolar
ZH JH   --> JH         voiced postalveolar
D Z     --> D          voiced alveolar
NG G    --> G          voiced velar
N L R   --> R          voiced alveolar2
# redundant:
K       --> K          voiceless velar
HH      --> HH         voiceless glottal
Y       --> Y          voiced lateral
TH      --> TH         voiceless dental
DH      --> DH         voiced dental
